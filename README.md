# selenium-testing
This is a training repository for me to continue working with Selenium and write test automation scripts in Python for Selenium (previously my selenium script writing was done in C#).

Project: To create test automation script(s) that will incorporate lots of testing scenarios across the numerous web based objects that could be incountered, and their functionality presented on the web pages provided by Selenium (https://www.selenium.dev/selenium/web/index.html).

As I work through the various pages, I will create test requirements like as if it was a real project to automate (and I will document it here).
