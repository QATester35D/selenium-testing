# selenium-testing
This is a practice training repository to continue working with Selenium and write test automation scripts in Python for Selenium (previously my selenium script writing was done all in C#).

Project: To create test automation script(s) that will incorporate lots of testing scenarios/interactions across numerous web based objects that could be encountered. Several websites will be used to include: 
- https://www.selenium.dev/selenium/web/
- https://formy-project.herokuapp.com/
- https://jqueryui.com/draggable/

As I work through the various pages and objects, I will tackle performing various actions just like I was a SDET working for the company that designed the site (like as if there were real test requirements associated with the test automation).
